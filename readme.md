ngComboDatePicker
=================

_Select dates with combo boxes_

**ngComboDatePicker** is an AngularJS directive to select dates using combo boxes.

[See the live demos and read the docs](http://jfmdev.github.io/ngComboDatePicker/ "ngComboDatePicker - Live demos and docs")

> If you use the React library, you should check [reactComboDatePicker](https://github.com/jfmdev/reactComboDatePicker), a fork of this project that uses React instead of Angular.  
> And if you use Angular 4+ (current directive works only on Angular 1.x), you should check [ngx-combo-datepicker](https://github.com/katafractari/ngx-combo-datepicker).

Usage
-----

In order to use this directive:

**1)** Include the library (located in the `source` folder of this repository) in the header of your HTML files, after including Angular (v1.4.0 or greater):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="ngComboDatePicker.min.js"></script>
```

> Note that, instead of cloning this repository, you can also get this library usins NPM (`npm install ng-combo-date-picker`) or Bower (`bower install ngComboDatePicker`).

**2)** Then add `ngComboDatePicker` as a dependency when declaring your Angular's app:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp',['ngComboDatePicker']);
```

**3)** Then include the directive in your HTML code. For example:

```html
<ng-combo-date-picker ng-model="myDate"></ng-combo-date-picker>
```

or

```html
<span ng-combo-date-picker="exp" ng-model="myDate"></span>
```

Attributes
----------

The _ngComboDatePicker_ directive supports the following attributes:

Name | Description
------------- | ----
`ngModel`  | (mandatory) A _Date_ object in which the picked date is going to be stored. This attribute can also be used to define the initial value of the picker.
`ngDate`  | A _string_ representing the initial date of the picker. Note that this value is read only once, when loading the component, so if you plan to change this value dynamically, then you should use the attribute `ngModel` instead.
`ngMinDate`  | A _string_ representing the minimum date that can be picked. By default the minimum date is 100 years before the current date. Note that this value is read only once, when loading the component, so if you plan to change this value dynamically, then you should use the attribute `ngMinModel` instead.
`ngMaxDate`  | A _string_ representing the maximum date that can be picked. By default the maximum date is the current date. Note that this value is read only once, when loading the component, so if you plan to change this value dynamically, then you should use the attribute `ngMaxModel` instead.
`ngMinModel`  | A _Date_ object indicating the minimum date that can be picked. By default the minimum date is 100 years before the current date.
`ngMaxModel`  | A _Date_ object indicating the maximum date that can be picked. By default the maximum date is the current date.
`ngTimezone`  | A _number_ indicating the timezone to be used when converting a string or an integer to a date. By default the timezone of the client is used. 
`ngMonths`  | A _string_ with the names of the twelve months, separated by comma. 
`ngOrder`  | A _string_ with the characters "d", "m" and "y" indicating in which order the combo boxes must be displayed. By default, the combo boxes are displayed in the order "dmy".
`ngAttrsDate`  | A _JSON_ object with the attributes (such as `class` or `style`) to add to the `select` element for the date. 
`ngAttrsMonth`  | A _JSON_ object with the attributes (such as `class` or `style`) to add to the `select` element for the month. 
`ngAttrsYear`  | A _JSON_ object with the attributes (such as `class` or `style`) to add to the `select` element for the year. 
`ngDisabled`  | A _boolean_, or an _array_ of three booleans, indicating if the combo boxes should be rendered as disabled. 
`ngYearOrder`  | A _string_ indicating if the years must be sorted in "ascending" or "descending" order.
